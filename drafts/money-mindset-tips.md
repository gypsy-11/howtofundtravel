# Cultivate Abundance: Money Mindset Tips to Fund Your Travel Dreams

Travelling expands your horizons and creates lasting memories. But let's face it, those experiences don't come for free. Cultivating a healthy money mindset is crucial for transforming your travel aspirations into reality.

So many people hold deep beliefs that they can't afford to travel or live abroad with their family. I used to wonder how on earth we could ever do it as a family of four (then five - and now six).

Shifting the way I thought about money and abundance has been key to unlocking our courage to go travelling indefinitely.

Here are some key tips to shift your thinking and unlock the abundance to fund your adventures:

âœ¨ **Shift from Scarcity to Abundance**: Many people view money as a limited resource. Instead, cultivate an abundance mindset. Believe that there are enough resources to fulfil your needs and desires, including travel. Books like The Key to Living the Law of Attraction and A Happy Pocket Full of Money explore this concept in detail.

âœ¨ **Focus on Gratitude**: Appreciating what you already have fosters a sense of abundance and attracts more opportunities. Practice daily gratitude, acknowledge your financial blessings, and visualize yourself achieving your travel goals. This one trick changed my life!

âœ¨ **Belief in Yourself and Your Ability to Earn**: Having a strong belief in your ability to generate income is essential. Books like "The Psychology of Money" and "The Secrets of the Millionaire Mind" provide insights into developing a wealth-building mindset.

âœ¨ **Reframe Your Money Story**: Our childhood experiences and societal messages often shape our relationship with money. Identify any limiting beliefs you hold about money and travel. Reframe these beliefs with empowering affirmations that support your travel goals.

âœ¨ **Set Travel Goals**: Having clear and specific goals motivates action. This provides a roadmap for your financial planning. I remember in 2010 making a goal to travel the world with my children by 2020. Sure enough, we set off on our full-time travel dream in 2020. But I always think, I should've made my goal 2015 - because it probably would've happened then if I'd focused on it earlier!!
