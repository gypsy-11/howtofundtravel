# How Remote Work Funds Our Family's Adventures (and Can Fund Yours Too!)

The dream of working remotely and travelling the world with your family is no longer just a fantasy. It's been around a while, but since 2020 there has been an explosion of opportunities to work remotely.

In June 2021, that dream became a reality for us! Thanks to the flexibility and freedom of remote work, we've been able to explore new destinations, experience diverse cultures, and create lasting memories together.

We've worked from Vietnam, Turkey, Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, back to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and New Zealand. We've even done a full round the world from Auckland New Zealand to New York, USA, back to New Zealand, over to Malaysia, to Spain, the UK, a trans-atlantic cruise (thanks Starlink), Caribbean islands, a couple of months in Dominican Republic, Colombia, Panama, Japan... And of course, back to our favourite place, Vietnam.

## How We Make It Work

Since 2021, the key to our nomadic lifestyle has been my remote job as a social media support specialist for a cryptocurrency wallet company.

I took this role in mid-2021 because our funds were almost dried up, and I was really worried our sole income stream was too reliant on third parties. It turns out my instincts were on point as shortly after I started work, our crypto platform reduced payments, and soon after, completely stopped payments. It was my first lesson in Pay to Profit platforms - I'll get into those in another blog soon. Be wary of anyone selling things where you need to 'invest' and earn a return. Especially when it is focused on crypto. You could lose a lot more than money (friends, your reputation - you name it)

## How Did I Get This Job?

Since around 2015, I began learning everything I could about online incomes and businesses. I had tried everything from blogging to coaching and courses, even high-ticket affiliate marketing.

Along the way, I invested tens of thousands into coaches, mentors and courses. One area in which I felt I learned a lot of valuable skills, and helped my online presence take off, was digital marketing.

Back in 2019, I invested in the Affiliate Institute as a founding member (I can't remember exactly how much I paid, but it was around $2k USD). Now, I think it still exists, but I can't even access the training. So don't buy something that costs $2K that you can't even access a couple of years down the track. That's just silly.

In saying that, it was excellent quality, and I learned a lot through many online live classes. I started running ads and refined my copywriting skills. I learned about attraction marketing.

It was the skills I learned during this time building my businesses, and building my online presence that helped me cross the line for my role!

## Benefits of Remote Work for Travel:

**Location Independence**: Remote work allows you to work from anywhere with a decent internet connection. This frees you from the constraints of a traditional office job and opens doors to travel opportunities.

**Flexible Hours**: Many remote jobs offer flexible schedules, allowing you to work around your travel plans and family commitments. I'm fortunate to be able to schedule 30-40 hours a week around my life. And it's worked for us!

**Work-Life Balance**: Remote work can often lead to a better work-life balance. You can structure your workday to accommodate travel experiences and spend quality time with loved ones.

## Finding Remote Work Opportunities:

There are numerous online platforms where you can find remote work opportunities:

- **Upwork**: A popular freelance marketplace where you can find remote work projects in various fields.
- **Fiverr**: Similar to Upwork, Fiverr allows you to offer your skills and services to remote clients.
- **FlexJobs**: A curated job board specializing in remote, work-from-home, and flexible work arrangements.
- **Remote.co**: Another platform dedicated to connecting job seekers with remote work opportunities.
- **Bitcoinerjobs.com**: This site is dedicated to jobs that are in the Bitcoin industry. It's common to receive your salary in Bitcoin from these companies.
- **CryptoJobsList**: A site that is dedicated to jobs in the crypto industry. You could receive your salary in all kinds of cryptocurrencies here, so just be careful if you're new to crypto - it wouldn't be wise to receive your income in some brand new token that you may not be able to exchange for $$ if you need them!
- **Cryptocurrency Jobs**: Another great site promoting jobs in the crypto industry.

## Learning Valuable Skills for Remote Work:

The ability to work remotely often hinges on having relevant skills. Investing in online courses or programs specializing in digital marketing, content creation, or virtual assistance can significantly enhance your chances of landing a remote job.

## From Remote Work to a World of Opportunity:

Remote work is a fantastic springboard for a location-independent lifestyle. It not only allows you to travel but also opens doors to other income streams, like affiliate marketing or starting an online business.

Side note: It's a lot less stressful building your side incomes when you have a steady income stream. It's even better if it's a remote role since you can then leverage lower cost-of-living countries while you build out your ultimate lifestyle.

## Our Story is Just the Beginning:

Our experience working around the world is a testament to the power of remote work. By leveraging your skills and embracing the possibilities, you too can turn your travel dreams into reality. With the right approach, remote work can be the key to unlocking a world of adventure for you and your family!
