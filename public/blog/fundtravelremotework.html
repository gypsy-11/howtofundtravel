                        <p>The dream of working remotely and travelling the world with your family is no longer just a fantasy. It's been around a while, but since 2020 there has been an explosion of opportunities to work remotely.</p>

                        <p>In June 2021, that dream became a reality for us! Thanks to the flexibility and freedom of remote work, we've been able to explore new destinations, experience diverse cultures, and create lasting memories together.</p>

                        <p>We've worked from Vietnam, Turkey, Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, back to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and New Zealand. We've even done a full round the world from Auckland New Zealand to New York, USA, back to New Zealand, over to Malaysia, to Spain, the UK, a trans-atlantic cruise (thanks Starlink), Caribbean islands, a couple of months in Dominican Republic, Colombia, Panama, Japan... And of course, back to our favourite place, Vietnam.</p>

                        <h2>How We Make It Work</h2>

                        <p>Since 2021, the key to our nomadic lifestyle has been my remote job as a social media support specialist for a cryptocurrency wallet company.</p>

                        <p>I took this role in mid-2021 because our funds were almost dried up, and I was really worried our sole income stream was too reliant on third parties. It turns out my instincts were on point as shortly after I started work, our crypto platform reduced payments, and soon after, completely stopped payments. It was my first lesson in Pay to Profit platforms - I'll get into those in another blog soon. Be wary of anyone selling things where you need to 'invest' and earn a return. Especially when it is focused on crypto. You could lose a lot more than money (friends, your reputation - you name it).</p>

                    <!-- How Did I Get This Job Section -->
                    <section class="blog-section">
                        <h2>How Did I Get This Job?</h2>

                        <p>Since around 2015, I began learning everything I could about online incomes and businesses. I had tried everything from blogging to coaching and courses, even high-ticket affiliate marketing.</p>

                        <p>Along the way, I invested tens of thousands into coaches, mentors and courses. One area in which I felt I learned a lot of valuable skills, and helped my online presence take off, was digital marketing.</p>

                        <p>Back in 2019, I invested in the Affiliate Institute as a founding member (I can't remember exactly how much I paid, but it was around $2k USD). Now, I think it still exists, but I can't even access the training. So don't buy something that costs $2K that you can't even access a couple of years down the track. That's just silly.</p>

                        <p>In saying that, it was excellent quality, and I learned a lot through many online live classes. I started running ads and refined my copywriting skills. I learned about attraction marketing.</p>

                        <p>It was the skills I learned during this time building my businesses, and building my online presence that helped me cross the line for my role!</p>

                                <h3>How much money do I need to start traveling while working remotely?</h3>
                                <p>You'll need enough savings to cover initial travel costs (flights, accommodation deposits, emergency fund) plus 2-3 months of living expenses. Many digital nomads start with $5,000-$10,000 USD. The beauty of remote work is that you can earn while traveling, reducing the financial burden.</p>

                                <p>Reliable internet is crucial. We use a combination of local SIM cards, portable WiFi devices, and services like Starlink for remote locations.
