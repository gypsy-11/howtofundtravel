#3! I need quick, easy bites since my bandwidth is teeny tiny, lol!
No one has time
We are either working hard at a job
Or working hard at life
And in some cases, working a job and trying to build a side hustle
Some of us are adding parenting to that
And travelling the world too
It doesn't leave the desired time to put in the love and effort your business deserves
Because we are stealing moments
We are grabbing one minute here
One minute there
But it's not really moving the needle
It's frustrating
When you work at something for three months
And then it's just not what you wanted
It's not what you imagined
You can't keep up with your ideas
In your head, you have ideas every day
Blog worthy ideas
But getting them out of your head
Into a page
With layout
And if your visually design challenged like I am,
Then it's hard. Really hard. Sometimes too hard.
It's easier to quit
To abandon the dreams
It's demotivating to see the microfootsteps
And wishing you had the time to invest into pumping out great quality content
I wonder, how many dreams died, not because someone didn't make an attempt,
But because they ran out of steam
Ran out of bandwidth
Ran out of energy
Burned the heck out
Got sick 
Became insomniac and realized it just wasn't worth it
Realizing that sustaining the effort for two years at bare minumum, turtle pace
Just wasn't enough to crack the code
It wasn't going to be enough to create freedom
It wasn't enough to cut the work ties and go all in
Because you just couldn't see it
I've cracked the code. 
And we don't have to struggle anymore
Now's our time
It's time for the rise of the ideas
If you have ideas, too many ideas
And no outlet
I found the outlet. 
I found the partner we all need
I found something far beyond the powers of ChatGPT
And the best bit is,
This is the most inefficient I'll ever be
I get to go faster and faster
And my quality increases every day
