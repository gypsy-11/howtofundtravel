## 🎉 Welcome to the Digital Nomads Community!

Hey [First Name],

You've just taken the first step toward reclaiming your location-independent freedom. No more late nights in Lisbon cafés doing keyword research. No more $500/month tool subscriptions that you barely understand.

**You're now part of a community of entrepreneurs who refuse to let marketing steal their adventures.**

## What Happens Next:

✅ **Check your email** - You'll receive webinar details within 24 hours
✅ **Add to calendar** - We'll send you a calendar invite with the exact date/time
✅ **Get your prep materials** - You'll receive our "60-Minute AI Workflow" cheat sheet
✅ **Join the community** - Connect with other nomads who've solved this problem

## 🚀 Quick Win: The 3-Question Business Analysis

Before the webinar, try this quick exercise that takes 5 minutes:

1. **What's your highest-value service/product?** (The one that brings in the most revenue)
2. **Who's your ideal client?** (Be specific - not "small business owners" but "location-independent consultants who charge $200+/hour")
3. **What's their biggest pain point?** (The thing that keeps them up at night)

This simple framework will help you get 10x more value from the webinar.

## 💡 Pro Tip for Nomads

Instead of trying to research keywords for every country you visit, focus on your core market first. Most successful nomads I know target one primary market (usually US, UK, or Australia) and then expand strategically.

**The webinar will show you exactly how to do this in under 60 minutes.**

## 🌍 You're Not Alone

You're joining a community of entrepreneurs who've been exactly where you are:
- Spending weekends on research instead of exploring new cities
- Paying for tools they don't fully understand
- Creating content that doesn't drive business results

**We're here to change that.**

## 📅 Save the Date

The webinar will be [DATE] at [TIME] [TIMEZONE]. I'll send you the exact link and login details 24 hours before we start.

**Pro tip:** Add our email to your contacts so you don't miss any updates while you're traveling!

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

In just 60 minutes, you'll discover:
- How to analyze your business and competitors in 15 minutes (not 15 hours)
- The exact AI tools that replace $500/month in subscriptions
- How to create a prioritized content plan that actually drives sales

## ✈️ Because Your Business Should Enable Your Adventures
