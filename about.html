                        <h3>Hi, I'm Melissa</h3>
                        
                        <p>For years, I dreamed of a life filled with travel and freedom. I envisioned our family living location-independently, supported by a fully remote income. After years of seeking the perfect formula through courses and mentors, the key turned out to be a leap of faith.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 2019, with very little savings or stable online income, we booked one-way tickets and embraced the unknown. This belief in creating our own path, along with some unexpected twists, has led us to an incredible journey of travel, personal growth, and financial autonomy.</p>
                        
                        <p>I've created this blog to share our experiences since we set off in February 2020. Here, I document the various ways we've tried (and often failed) to fund our travels. Explore the strategies we discovered, and hopefully, you'll find something that resonates and works for you and your family.</p>
