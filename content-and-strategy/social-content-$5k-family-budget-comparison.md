🏠 **Housing quality varies drastically** at same price point  
🍽️ **Food costs depend on your compromise level**
💰 **$5K works in 2/4 places** - but lifestyle matters

The 'live anywhere for $2K' crowd? They're usually single, childless, or not showing the full picture."

### Slide 8: Our Family's Reality
**Text:**
"After 3 years of this life with 4 kids, here's what we've learned:

✨ **Budget for the unexpected** (always)
✨ **Research school systems first** (education = biggest variable)
✨ **Factor in your sanity** (cheap isn't always better)
✨ **Geographic arbitrage is real** - but do the math first

"The $5K family travel budget question... let's get real about it 💰

Every week someone asks: 'How much do you REALLY need for a family of 6 to travel?'

So I did the research on 4 places we've considered. The numbers might surprise you (they surprised me!)

Here's the thing - most travel budget advice comes from single nomads or couples. Family travel? It's a whole different game.

The biggest shocker? Education costs can literally make or break your budget. In Vietnam, choosing international schools triples your monthly expenses. In New Zealand, quality education is basically free.

Housing is another reality check. That $1,000 gets you a gorgeous villa with a pool in Bali, but barely covers a basic apartment in Sydney.

And food? Well, when you're feeding 6 people, even 'cheap' countries add up fast.

I'm not here to crush dreams - we've made this work for our family. But I am here to give you the real numbers so you can plan properly.

Because the last thing I want is for a family to make the leap without understanding what they're getting into.

Your turn: Which of these destinations surprised you most? And what other places should I research next?

**Subject:** "The $5K Family Travel Budget Myth (Real Numbers Inside)"

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

I got this question three times this week:

*"How much do you REALLY need for a family of 6 to travel full-time?"*

So I decided to stop giving vague answers and do the actual research.

I looked at 4 destinations we've been considering - Vietnam, Bali, New Zealand, and Australia - and broke down what $5K/month actually gets a family of 6.

The results? Let's just say the "live anywhere for cheap" crowd has some explaining to do.

**Here's what I found:**

In **Hoi An, Vietnam**, $5K works beautifully... IF you put your kids in local schools. Choose international education? You're looking at $5K+ minimum.

In **Sanur, Bali**, it's tight but doable - again, depending on school choices. That Instagram-worthy villa life? Possible, but with sacrifices elsewhere.

**Tauranga, New Zealand** was the surprise winner. Quality free education and healthcare made $3-4K totally comfortable.

**Cronulla, Sydney**? Forget it. You need $10K+ minimum for any kind of reasonable family life.

The biggest lesson? **Education is everything.**

In some countries, quality education is free. In others, it can cost $2K+ per month per child. For a family with 4 kids, this changes everything.

The second lesson? **Housing quality varies wildly.**

$1,200 gets you a stunning villa in Vietnam but barely covers a basic apartment in Australia.

I'm sharing this because I want families to dream big AND plan smart. The nomad life is amazing, but surprises can be expensive.

Want the full breakdown with all the numbers? I've posted it on Instagram [@fulltimefamilytravel].

What other destinations should I research next?

**Post:**
"I researched the $5K/month family travel budget myth. Here's what I found:

As remote work normalizes, more families ask: 'How much do we need to travel full-time?'

Most advice comes from solo nomads. Family reality? Completely different.

I analyzed 4 destinations for a family of 6:

🇻🇳 **Vietnam**: $1,750-$5,000 (education is the variable)
🇮🇩 **Bali**: $3,180-$7,050 (lifestyle choices matter)
🇳🇿 **New Zealand**: $2,460-$3,810 (free education/healthcare wins)
🇦🇺 **Australia**: $8,950-$12,500 (not happening on $5K)

**Key insights:**
→ Education costs can triple family budgets
→ Geographic arbitrage is real but limited with kids
→ Housing quality varies dramatically at same price points
→ Healthcare access changes everything

For families considering location independence: Plan for education first, housing second, lifestyle third.
