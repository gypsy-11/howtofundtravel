### SERP & Competitor Analysis
- **Content Format:** Mostly listicles, checklists, and how-to guides. Some targeted at specific demographics (e.g., Gen X women).

- **Industry-Specific Recommendations:** Rare; most advice is generic, with some mention of travel insurance or rewards programs.
- **Workflow Integration:** Minimal; some suggest integrating savings with pre-trip planning, but few offer step-by-step, automated workflows or budgeting app integration.
- **ROI/Cost-Benefit:** Implicit (e.g., “save 41% by booking early”), but rarely quantified with real-world examples or calculators.

#### Content Gaps
- Lack of interactive, customizable saving guides or tools.
- Few data-driven case studies or ROI visualizations.

- **Workflow Integration:** Some practical “how to search” advice, but little on integrating with budgeting apps, automation, or expense tracking.
