## ðŸ’¡ Quick Win: The 80/20 Rule for Women Entrepreneurs

Before the masterclass, try this simple strategy that takes 10 minutes:

**Instead of trying to be everywhere on social media, focus on the 2-3 platforms where your ideal clients actually spend time.**

For most women entrepreneurs, this is usually:
- Instagram (for visual businesses, coaching, lifestyle)
- LinkedIn (for B2B, consulting, professional services)
- Pinterest (for creative businesses, products, inspiration)

**Master one platform before expanding to others.**

In just 60 minutes, you'll discover:
- How to create a complete marketing strategy in under an hour
- The AI tools that save you 10+ hours per week on content creation

- The systematic approach that eliminates marketing overwhelm

## ðŸ’ª You're in Good Company

You're joining a community of women who've been exactly where you are:
