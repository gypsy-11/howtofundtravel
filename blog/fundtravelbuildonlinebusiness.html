                        <div class="blog-hero-subtitle">
                            <p>The allure of remote work and the freedom to travel the world while earning a living is a powerful motivator. Building an online business can turn that dream into reality. But before diving in, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of this approach.</p>

                    <!-- Introduction Section -->
                    <section class="blog-section">
                        <p>Our family saved (not that much) and planned to live off our savings while we attempted to make an income with an online business.</p>

                        <div class="callout-box">
                            <p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> Our plan didn't go to plan!!</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>We'd planned to build a travel blog business - but thanks to setting off in February 2020, we put that plan on the back burner. Some of the most well-known travel bloggers in the world watched their online incomes reduce almost overnight. It wasn't the right time to be starting to earn online. For us anyway. We only had a limited time frame, and we couldn't wait with hopes that the travel blogging industry would bounce back in time before our tiny savings account ran out.</p>

                        <p>We had a backup plan in place. High-ticket affiliate marketing. I have a post coming on that soon. This is commonly marketed as a freedom lifestyle business. I bought into the hype thinking I'd be one of the overnight success (back in 2018 - two years before we left) and I wasn't. I gave it a very good crack. I was waking up at 4:30am most days, writing, journaling, running ads, doing the inner work, yet it didn't translate to sales.</p>

                        <p>When we realized our blog wasn't going to work in 2020, I attempted to sell my high-ticket offer again, but I think at that point I probably had lost my belief in it (yes, I'm embarrassed to say I was one of those corny people writing cute copy about how high-ticket affiliate marketing was going to set us free).</p>

                        <p>Here's a bit of what we have learned about building an online business ðŸ‘‡</p>

                                <p>An online business allows you to work from anywhere with an internet connection. This frees you from the constraints of a traditional office job and allows you to travel the world while managing your business.</p>

                                <h3>ðŸ’¡ Time Commitment</h3>
                                <p>Building a successful online business takes time and effort. Don't expect overnight success. Be prepared to put in the hard work upfront to establish your brand and attract customers. Despite some people pretending like it's a walk in the park, it's not. Be prepared for inconsistency and ups and downs while you're building. There might be great months, but there also may be times when you don't have any income.</p>

                                <p>Without a physical workplace or boss overseeing you, self-discipline is crucial. You'll need to manage your time effectively and stay motivated to reach your goals. This means it's likely you're going to have to drag your ass out of bed earlier than the rest of your family (if you're travelling as a family) to get shit done. But on a better note, once you're generating income, you can often hire a VA to support you while you continue to build.</p>
